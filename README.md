# Apriori-Eclat-Association-Rules-Learning-in-python-and-R
This repository contains implementations of two widely used association rule learning techniques: Apriori and Eclat.
Each algorithm is organized in its own folder with:

Dedicated scripts in Python and R

Sample datasets for demonstration

Instructions and explanations for generating frequent itemsets and association rules

Algorithms Included

Apriori – Generates frequent itemsets and association rules using the Apriori principle.

Eclat – Efficiently computes frequent itemsets using vertical data representation and intersection of transaction IDs.
